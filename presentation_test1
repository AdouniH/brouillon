In order to save and re-use the style of an object,
--> we need to find a way to store this information so it can be accessed easily. 
we chose JSON.

The next question is : what do we stylize ? 
- is it single mesh 
- or a complex object with several styles at once


Two stylization methods will be created --> there will also be two types of style formats :



When one layer is checked, three buttons appear :

--> Stylize object : open a symbolizer to stylize all the meshes of the objects at once.
--> Stylize parts : open a symbolizer to stylize the meshes of the objects independently (the objects must have the same number of meshes).
--> Delete layers : delete the objects.
